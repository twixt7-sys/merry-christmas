Screenshot guidelines

- Recommended desktop sizes: 1366×768, 1920×1080
- Recommended mobile portrait sizes: 375×812, 390×844
- File naming: `screenshot-<device>-<width>x<height>.png`

Quick tips

- Use the browser device toolbar (DevTools) to emulate mobile sizes.
- Disable extensions that inject UI when capturing.
- For consistent results, capture with a dark theme enabled.

Example
