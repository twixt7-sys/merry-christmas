# Christmas Card Webpage

A small, warm single-page Christmas card experience with ambient visuals, snow effects, and a hold-to-open gift interaction that reveals a heartfelt message and music.

    Feel free to fork and write your own message! :)

## Live Preview

Open `index.html` in your browser or serve the folder with a local static server.


## Features
- Hold-to-open gift interaction with countdown
- Ambient snow, stars, and particle effects
- Soft background music with a mobile-friendly volume prompt
- Fully responsive layout and accessible controls

## Layout & scrolling
This version limits horizontal scrolling and only allows vertical scrolling when content grows (e.g. long message text). If you see any horizontal scroll, try clearing browser cache or resize the window.

## Screenshots & Templates
See `screenshots/README.md` for recommended screenshot sizes, naming conventions, and a convenient issue template for submitting screenshots.

## Development notes
- Source files for the card: `christmas-card/style.css`, `christmas-card/script.js`, `index.html`.
- Music file: `christmas-card/song.mp3`

### Accessibility & mobile
- The overlay handles blocked autoplay gracefully and enables users to tap to enable sound.
- Visuals are disabled by default on older/smaller devices to preserve performance.
